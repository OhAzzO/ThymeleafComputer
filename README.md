Creating new project for Thymeleaf
for better structure, wanting to take some code from old project.

Plan.
Create a hello world html and import previous code into this.
I would like this to be more of a build tracker been able to house multiple computer builds with tips regarding
  parts and things to remember.
planning to have a submitting page that will have details about users computer build including parts, overview, price.

Time promoting i would like to make fields for the parts having someway to tell they are compatible or not.
